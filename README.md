# Accord.py

A testing library for the discord.py library

[Documentation available in GitHub pages](https://eddiethecubehead.github.io/accord.py/)

Work In Progress

## Current status

The library is currently in early alpha. I am testing the library in my own bot projects and adding features
accordingly. The following are my current minimum feature requirements for moving on to beta.

[x] Should be able to send app commands to the bot
[ ] Should be able to send discord events to the bot
[ ] Should provide the created mock data on fetches
[x] Should have API-documentation automatically generated from docstrings
[ ] Should have hand-made tutorial(s) and quickstart
